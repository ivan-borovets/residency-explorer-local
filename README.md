## Installation and Setup (for Windows users)
1. Install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/).
2. Generate the `.env` file. This step is required only once during the 
installation.

   2.1. Open `PowerShell`

   2.2. Navigate to the root directory of the project
   
   2.3. Run
      ```bash
      python ./scripts/generate_dotenv/dotenv_from_toml.py
      ```
## Running the Application (for Windows users)
### First-Time Launch
1. Ensure the `.env` file is present in the root directory of the project.
2. From the root of the project, open PowerShell and run the following command:
```bash
docker compose up --build
```
This will build and start the application. Once the application is ready, 
you will be prompted to visit [0.0.0.0:8888](http://0.0.0.0:8888) in your browser.

### Subsequent Launches
After the first launch, you can start and manage the application directly 
from `Docker Desktop`.

Open `Docker Desktop` and navigate to the `Containers` section.
You will find a shortcut to start the application under the 
`residency-explorer-local` container.
After starting the container, you can click on the link labeled `8888:8888` 
to open the application in your browser.
**It is recommended to stop** the application in `Docker Desktop` when 
you're done using it to free up system resources.

- `SQLAlchemy`: ORM for database interactions.
- `Psycopg2`: Synchronous PostgreSQL adapter for Python.
> Because `starlette-admin` seem not to support async engines 
- `Alembic`: Database migrations tool for SQLAlchemy.

#### Data Management:
- `Pydantic`: Data validation and type checking.
- `Pydantic-Settings`: Handling of env variables and settings.

### Customization

The primary configuration file for the application is `config.toml`. 
After making any changes to this file, you must generate a new `.env` file. 
This can be done using the scripts available in the 
`./scripts/generate_dotenv/` directory for either `Python` or `Bash`.

It's important to ensure that the `.env` file is correct, as only with 
a properly configured `.env` will the 
```bash
docker compose up --build
``` 
function correctly.
